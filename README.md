# Team BBG's Code-fiesta submission

### Write up

Singaporeans who have been overseas for an extended period of time are not  up to date with significant changes to Singapore's dynamic policies. Given the circumstances of the ever evoliving Covid-19 situation, it is more apparent that policy changes are more frequent than ever.

Therefore, our group aims to bridge this gap by streamlining the process of gathering policy changes for not only returning, but also domestic Singaporeans, so that they will be up to speed in mere minutes!
